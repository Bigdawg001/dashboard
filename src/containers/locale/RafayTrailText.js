      hereby grants Participant a non-exclusive, non-transferable,
      non-sublicenseable right to engage in internal, non-production testing of
      the Rafay Platform solely to evaluate the Rafay Platform. If the parties
      mutually agree in writing (email to suffice) that Participant will pay a
      fee for access to the Rafay Platform (“Trial Fee”), such Trial Fee is
      non-refundable and exclusive of all taxes, levies or duties imposed by
      taxing authorities, if any (for which Participant will be responsible,
      excluding taxes based on Rafay’s income).

      requirements for, the Rafay Platform.
      <br />
      <br />
      (b) Rafay shall have full discretion to determine whether or not to
      proceed with the development of any requested enhancements, new features

      trial purposes will continue for thirty (30) days after such creation
      (“Trial Period”). However, if Participant desires to extend the Trial
      Period, it may contact Rafay at support@rafay.co or by contacting
      Participant’s Rafay sales representative, and Rafay may agree in writing
      (email to suffice) to extend the Trial Period in its sole discretion.{" "}
      <br />
      <br />
      (b) Either party may also terminate this Agreement for any reason upon

      termination of this Agreement.
      <br />
      <br />
      4.
      <b>Proprietary Rights:</b>
      <br />
      <br />
      (a) As between the parties, Rafay retains all rights, title and interest
      in and to Rafay Platform. In addition, notwithstanding anything herein,
      if, as a result of the parties’ activities hereunder, the parties jointly
      author, invent or create, or Participant authors, invents or creates, any
      software, data, inventions or other intellectual property to be included
      in the Rafay Platform (“Platform Improvements”), Rafay will own all right,
      title and interest in and to such Platform Improvements, and Participant
      hereby makes all assignments necessary to accomplish the foregoing
      ownership. Participant will reasonably cooperate with Rafay to perfect
      such rights, at Rafay’s reasonable expense.
      <br />
      <br />
      (b) Participant will not (a) sublicense, resell, rent, lease, transfer,
      assign, time share, broadcast, republish, modify, distribute or otherwise
      commercially exploit or make the Rafay Platform available to any third
      party; (b) use the Rafay Platform in any unlawful manner, (c) modify,
      adapt or hack the Rafay Platform, or otherwise attempt to gain
      unauthorized access to the Rafay Platform or its related systems or

      Rafay, third party platform providers, users or otherwise) or labels from
      the Rafay Platform. Further, Participant will not, and will not permit any
      third party to, reverse engineer or otherwise attempt to discover the
      source code or underlying structure or algorithms of the Rafay Platform,
      modify or create derivative works based on the Rafay Platform, or
      otherwise use the Rafay Platform outside of the scope expressly permitted
      under this Agreement.
      <br />
      <br />
      (c) “Confidential Information” means any information, software and
      know-how disclosed or made available by either party (the “disclosing
      party”) to the other party (the “receiving party”) hereunder. The
      receiving party shall: (i) not use the disclosing party’s Confidential
      Information except for the exercise of its rights or performance of its
      obligations hereunder; (ii) not disclose such Confidential Information to
      any party, other than its employees and consultants who have a “need to
      know” for the receiving party to exercise its rights or perform its
      obligations hereunder; and (iii) use at least reasonable measures to
      protect the confidentiality of such Confidential Information. If the
      receiving party is required by law to make any disclosure of such
      Confidential Information, the receiving party shall first give written
      notice of such requirement to the disclosing party, and shall permit the
      disclosing party to intervene in any relevant proceedings to protect its
      interests in the Confidential Information, and provide full cooperation to
      the disclosing party in seeking to obtain such protection. Information
      will not be deemed Confidential Information hereunder if such information:
      (1) is known or becomes known (independently of disclosure by the
      disclosing party) to the receiving party prior to receipt from the
      disclosing party from a source other than one having an obligation of
      confidentiality to the disclosing party; (2) becomes publicly known,
      except through a breach hereof by the receiving party; or (3) is
      independently developed by the receiving party without any use of the
      disclosing party’s Confidential Information.

      defects or deficiencies which cannot or may not be corrected by Rafay. THE
      RAFAY PLATFORM IS PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. RAFAY
      DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS, AND CONDITIONS RELATING
      TO THE RAFAY PLATFORM, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
      LIMITED TO, ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, OR CONDITION OF MERCHANTABILITY,

      <br />

      <b>Limitation of Liability:</b> EXCEPT FOR LIABILITY ARISING FROM A BREACH
      OF SECTION 4, IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE HEREUNDER FOR (A)
      LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, OR LOSS OR INACCURACY OF DATA, OR ANY INDIRECT,
      INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR (B) ANY OTHER
      AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE GREATER OF THE TRIAL FEE (IF ANY) AND ONE HUNDRED
      DOLLARS ($100), IN EACH CASE EVEN IF THE PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
      POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
      <br />
      <br />
      7.
      <b>Miscellaneous:</b> Rafay may revise this Agreement from time to time
      and any revisions will be effective upon the Last Updated date indicated
      at the top of this Agreement. Participant’s continued access or use of the
      Rafay Platform as part of a trial constitutes its acceptance of any
      revisions. For all purposes under this Agreement each party shall be and
      act as an independent contractor and shall not bind nor attempt to bind
      the other to any contract. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of
      the State of California without regard to the principles of conflicts of
      law. Each party hereby expressly agree to submit to the exclusive personal
      jurisdiction of the federal and state courts of the State of California
      for the purpose of resolving any dispute relating to this Agreement or
      Participant’s access to or use of the Rafay Platform. Neither party shall
      have the right to assign this Agreement, except that either party may
      assign its rights and obligations without consent to a successor to
      substantially all its relevant assets or business. In the event that any
      provision of this Agreement shall be determined to be illegal or
      unenforceable, that provision will be limited or eliminated so that this
      Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.
      The failure of either party to exercise or enforce any right or provision
      of this Agreement shall not be a waiver of that right.
